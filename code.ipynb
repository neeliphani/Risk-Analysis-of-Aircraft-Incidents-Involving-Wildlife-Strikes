Use this data set to see if you can predict the cost of a bird strike (i.e., the `Total Cost` column in the data set) based on the attributes of the incident. This is important because this model can make a cost prediction as soon as a bird strike incident happens."

    "* Recommended approach: \n",
    "    * import the data and perform the train/test split - like we always do. \n",
    "    * identify the names of numeric, categorical, feature engineered, and text columns - like we always do\n",
    "    * create individual pipelines for each type of column - like we always do. For the text pipeline, I would recommend the TFIDF Vectorizer with SVDs. Though, you can also use TFIDF Vectorizer with top N terms (without SVDs).\n",
