Overview:
This project analyzes aircraft incidents involving wildlife strikes to identify factors influencing incident costs. The insights gained can help airlines and aviation authorities enhance risk management and develop effective mitigation strategies, improving safety and reducing costs.

Narrative of Key Steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Data Sources: Compiled a dataset including variables like aircraft type, number of engines, airline, origin state, phase of flight, object size, weather conditions, warning status, altitude, and total cost.
Cleaning and Aggregation: Processed the data using Python and Pandas to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualization: Leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of the data, identifying trends and correlations.
Insights: Determined that object size and altitude are significant factors in the cost of incidents.
Model Building:

Regression Analysis: Conducted regression analysis using Scikit-learn to quantify the impact of various factors on incident costs.
Feature Engineering: Engineered features to improve model accuracy, considering interactions between variables.
Model Evaluation:

Metrics: Evaluated the model's performance using R-squared and mean squared error (MSE).
Key Findings: Object size and altitude were found to significantly influence incident costs.
Results and Deployment:

Key Findings: Provided recommendations for airlines and aviation authorities to focus on high-risk scenarios.
Business Value: Improved risk management strategies can lead to enhanced safety and reduced financial losses from wildlife strikes.
